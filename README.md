# Flappy Bird AI
This program is a Flappy Bird replica where AI agents will try to solve the game using neural networks using the
NEAT framework.

The agents take in an input of Bird position and the top/bottom pipe positions to decide when to jump.
If all the agents die then the bird that made it the furtherest will respawn with 10 new generations
with slightly different variations, this process is repeated untill we create a bot that can play infinitely.
